# Digital-Logic-Design

The purpose of our project is to design a circuit which will display “HELLOCSE231-3-8” via a 7 segment display. This project has two parts.

    1. Combinational Part
    2. Sequential Part.

In the combinational part, we have designed a combinational circuit using 8:1 multiplexers. We  used multiplexers because it is easy to implement and to minimize the circuit. In this part, we have shown that string in the 7 segment display by changing inputs manually.

And, in the sequential part we have designed a sequential circuit using basic logic gates and Flip-Flops . We used 2 JK Flip-Flops and 2 T Flip-Flops. Because of using the combination of JK and T Flip-Flops ,we found the most simplified circuit. In the end of this   part ,we were able to generate the string in the 7 segment display by changing the clock pulse.
